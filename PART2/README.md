![Timing Path Diagram](images/timingpath.png)
A timing path is a chain of connected logic elements through which a signal propagates.

## ⏱️ What is Arrival Time?

The **arrival time (AT)** is the **actual time** at which a signal reaches a particular point (usually the **endpoint**) in the circuit.
**Required Time** = Allowed time for signal arrival
